                    <p>Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting computers, servers, mobile devices, networks, and
                        data
                        from malicious attacks, damage, or unauthorized access. In today’s digital world, where most of
                        our
                        personal and professional lives are connected to the internet, cybersecurity is more crucial
                        than
                        ever.</p>


                    <h2 id="why-is">Why is Cybersecurity Important?</h2>
                    <p>The increasing reliance on technology means that the risks associated with cyber threats are
                        higher
                        than ever. Cybersecurity is essential to:

                    <p>
                        To protect yourself from cyber threats, it's important to follow a few basic cybersecurity best
                        practices:
                    <details>
                        <summary>Use Strong Passwords</summary>
                        Create complex passwords that are difficult to guess. A good password includes a mix of letters,
                        numbers, and symbols. Consider using a password manager to keep track of your passwords
                        securely.

                    <details>
                        <summary>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)</summary>
                        This extra layer of security requires you to verify your identity through something you know (a
                        password) and something you have (like a phone or email).
                    </details>

                    <details>
                        <summary>Avoid Public Wi-Fi for Sensitive Activities</summary>
                        Public Wi-Fi networks are more susceptible to attacks. When accessing sensitive information, use
                        a secure network or a VPN.
                    </details>
                    <details>
